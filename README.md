## 💼 Professional Experience

### Internship : Medical LLM (Platform for Ocular Imaging Research, HOJG) Aug 2025 - Feb 2026

This semester, I am currently working as an intern within the Platform for Ocular Imagin Research at Jules Gonin. At the hospital, a growing body of unstructured text data from electronic health records (EHR) provides a valuable yet underutilized source of clinical insight. My internship’s project focuses on training and fine-tuning an LLM
to read and understand these medical records, with the primary goal of performing automated inference on patient diag-
noses. The broader vision is to develop a general-purpose clinical assistant capable of supporting multiple downstream
tasks such as summarization, risk stratification, and interactive querying of patient history

### Student assistant experience
Thanks to my excellent grades in their respective courses, I worked as a student assistant for professors Karl Aberer and Patrick Thiran.
• [Advanced Information, Computation, Communication I](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-information-computation-communication-i-CS-101) (Autumn 2021, Grade: 6/6)
• [Modèles Stochastiques pour les Communications](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/modeles-stochastiques-pour-les-communications-COM-300) (Autumn 2023, Grade: 5.75/6)

## 📈 Projects

### 🛰️ Master Research Project in Computer Vision : 6D pose estimator for spacecraft images  
Semester project conducted at CVLAB (EPFL) with the aim to explore how well Vision Transformers can do 6D-pose estimation on spacecraft images (SPEED dataset) and compare them with more classical PnP based techniques.

### 🍿 The wizardry of good movies
[Website](https://math-ruch.github.io/yamal_group/)

**Description** : This project consisted in leveraging a large movies data set to analyze factors influencing box office success. Utilized data analysis tools, including regression models, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, to examine elements such as release timing, genre, plot sentiment, and casting choices. We Developed predictive models to assess the impact of these variables on financial performance, providing actionable insights for the film industry. Contributed to the creation of a public-facing website to present findings and visualizations, effectively communicating complex analyses to a broader audience.

### 💻 Anonymous Proof-of-Presence groups for Messaging, Voting and Digital Currency

[Project report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KOdHVzxPAk7mXxAHW3l8bcR4hrawAXKy/view?usp=share_link)

**Description** : Under the supervision of Pr. Bryan Ford, and Pr. Pierluca Bors`o-Tan, I worked in a Scala backend team for the [Decentralized and distributed systems lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/student-projects/) to migrate a minimalistic but highly robust and usable proof-of-presence group communication app for mobile devices from a centralized single server to a decentralized multiple server application. The app enables anyone to organize an in-person event, and take a secure “roll-call” at that event to connect with attendees and give each a one-per-person digital membership token. With these tokens, attendees can message each other, participate in an election or exchange currency without needing any strong identities (phone numbers etc), but with the ability to hold all participants accountable.

### 🚂 Lausanne Stochastic Journey Planner
[Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJ0uPh1vro61GA8mqQ6dl7onuTatKKeP/view?usp=sharing)

**Description** : This project consisted in leveraging the data published on the [Open Data Platform Mobility Switzerland](https://opentransportdata.swiss/fr/) for developing a robust public transport route planner using historical data and predictive modeling to compute the fastest and most reliable routes within a specified confidence interval. We Designed and implemented algorithms to account for schedule uncertainties, optimize route selection, and minimize travel risks. Created a visualization interface using Jupyter widgets to demonstrate the planner's functionality, ensuring usability and clarity.

### 🏎 Mountain car project
[Code](https://github.com/BelghmiAmine/ANNRL_MP1)

**Description** : Reinforcement learning project where I applied principles of Q-learning in order to solve the classical mountain car problem under the constraint that less than 200 actions should be taken for each game during the learning process.

### ♟ Optical Character Recognition for Handwritten Chess Move Digitization
[Code](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-chess_moves)
Under the supervision of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) and lab supervisor Von Däniken Pius, I contributed to developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model tailored for digitizing handwritten chess moves. This project addresses the inefficiencies and errors inherent in the traditional manual process of recording and digitizing chess competition data. Using a dataset of 2,671 cropped images of handwritten chess moves paired with their correct labels, we fine-tuned a pre-trained OCR model to specialize in recognizing chess notation. By leveraging a constrained output dictionary of valid chess moves, our approach optimized accuracy while simplifying the complexity of hyperparameter selection.
