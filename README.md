# Amine's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio on GitHub! Here, you'll find projects that showcase my expertise in data science, machine learning, and data visualization, reflecting my journey through the world of data analytics.



## üôã About Me

I'm Amine, based in Lausanne, Switzerland. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at EPFL.
My passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights has led me through several exciting internships and projects. I am particularly keen on exploring new technologies and utilizing machine learning to uncover meaningful patterns in data.

## üìà Projects

### üíª Anonymous Proof-of-Presence groups for Messaging, Voting and Digital Currency

[Project report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KOdHVzxPAk7mXxAHW3l8bcR4hrawAXKy/view?usp=share_link)

**Description** : Under the supervision of Pr. Bryan Ford, and Pr. Pierluca Bors`o-Tan, I worked in a Scala backend team for the [Decentralized and distributed systems lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/student-projects/) to migrate a minimalistic but highly robust and usable proof-of-presence group communication app for mobile devices from a centralized single server to a decentralized multiple server application. The app enables anyone to organize an in-person event, and take a secure ‚Äúroll-call‚Äù at that event to connect with attendees and give each a one-per-person digital membership token. With these tokens, attendees can message each other, participate in an election or exchange currency without needing any strong identities (phone numbers etc), but with the ability to hold all participants accountable.

### üöÇ Lausanne Stochastic Journey Planner
[Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJ0uPh1vro61GA8mqQ6dl7onuTatKKeP/view?usp=sharing)

**Description** : This project consisted in leveraging the data published on the [Open Data Platform Mobility Switzerland](https://opentransportdata.swiss/fr/) for developing a robust public transport route planner using historical data and predictive modeling to compute the fastest and most reliable routes within a specified confidence interval. We Designed and implemented algorithms to account for schedule uncertainties, optimize route selection, and minimize travel risks. Created a visualization interface using Jupyter widgets to demonstrate the planner's functionality, ensuring usability and clarity.

### üçø The wizardry of good movies
[Website](https://math-ruch.github.io/yamal_group/)

**Description** : This project consisted in leveraging a large movies data set to analyze factors influencing box office success. Utilized data analysis tools, including regression models, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, to examine elements such as release timing, genre, plot sentiment, and casting choices. Developed predictive models to assess the impact of these variables on financial performance, providing actionable insights for the film industry. Contributed to the creation of a public-facing website to present findings and visualizations, effectively communicating complex analyses to a broader audience.

### üèé Mountain car project
[Code](https://github.com/BelghmiAmine/ANNRL_MP1)

**Description** : Reinforcement learning project where I applied principles of Q-learning in order to solve the classical mountain car problem under the constraint that less than 200 actions should be taken for each game during the learning process.

### ‚ôü Optical Character Recognition for Handwritten Chess Move Digitization
[Code](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-chess_moves)
Under the supervision of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) and lab supervisor Von D√§niken Pius, I contributed to developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model tailored for digitizing handwritten chess moves. This project addresses the inefficiencies and errors inherent in the traditional manual process of recording and digitizing chess competition data. Using a dataset of 2,671 cropped images of handwritten chess moves paired with their correct labels, we fine-tuned a pre-trained OCR model to specialize in recognizing chess notation. By leveraging a constrained output dictionary of valid chess moves, our approach optimized accuracy while simplifying the complexity of hyperparameter selection.
